	 * -Most important feature of polymorphism is one of the primary 
	 * reason we have class structure and virtual method
	 * -Virtual method is a method in which specific implementation
	 * is not known until runtime (until we run the code)
	 * -In java, all methods that are not static or final or private
	 * are considered virtual methods, since they can be overridden. For
	 * example, c++ has keyword 'virtual' but in java we don't have that 
	 * keyword 
	 * -What makes virtual method special in java is that you can call
	 * method on object that overrided a method, you get the overridden
	 * method even if the method is on the parent reference
