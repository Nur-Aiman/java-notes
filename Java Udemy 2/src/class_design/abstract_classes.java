	 * 
	 * 1) Abstract classes can not be instantiated directly
	 * 
	 * 2) Abstract classes can have 0 to many abstract methods
	 * 
	 * 3) Abstract classes cannot be private or final
	 * 
	 * 4) Abstract class that extends another abstract class inherits all of its
	 * abstract methods as its own abstract methods
	 * 
	 * 5) The first concrete class that extends an abstract class must provide
	 * implementation for all of the inherited abstract methods
	 * 
	 * -concrete class is class that is not abstract
